## Dynamic Pricing

Movie ticket prices change dynamically based on:

Weekend Pricing: +10% increase on Saturday & Sunday

Peak Hours (7 PM - 10 PM): +5% increase

Early Booking Discount: -10% for first few seats

High Demand Pricing:

+5% if more than 30% of seats booked

+30% if more than 70% of seats booked

 Instead of making a separate simulation endpoint , I have encorporated the above in other routes itself. It checks if 70% seats
 are booked when a new booking happens . And other conditions such as weekend , peak hours etc , are checked when admin adds a new movie.
